### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dominik, a data scientist in Hamburg, Germany.

Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/d_haitz) or via my [homepage](https://dhaitz.github.io/).

I'm working mostly in the Python data ecosystem, but I'm curious to learn more about web and app development.
